woofQ2 is a new build system for EasyOS. The previous, woofQ, is still being developed, but considered to be in maintenance-mode.

The first release of EasyOS built with woofQ2 is version 7.0. The release announcement on Barry's Blog has links that explain the development and genesis of woofQ2:

woofQ2 is currently not in a fit state to be placed on github, due to excessive bundled binary files. For now, it is available as two tarballs, as linked-to in the above 7.0 announcement. Also, link provided here:

...there is also a readme file that explains how to use woofQ2.

The bundled binary files means that it is possible to do a complete build of EasyOS offline.

EasyOS is an experimental linux distribution and along with woofQ and woofQ2, continuing evolving. Follow the progress on Barry's Blog:
